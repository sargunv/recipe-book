## Steps
### Section 1
Khichdi is a classic Indian rice and lentil porridge. This recipe is a quick and
easy version that uses frozen vegetables and an electric pressure multi-cooker.

### Prep rice and lentil mix
1. Mix white rice, moong dal, and masoor dal in a large bowl and rinse them 3-4
times with tap water.

### Prep spices
1. Set aside cumin seeds in a small bowl.

2. Set aside the ground spices in another small bowl: ground turmeric root,
ground coriander seed, ground cayenne pepper, and hing.

### Cooking
1. Set pressure multi-cooker to saut√©, add avocado oil, and pre-heat on medium.

2. When the oil is hot, add cumin seeds.

3. When the cumin starts to sputter, add the ground spices.

4. After simmering the spices for about 1 minute, add the rice and lentil mix
and salt. Stir to mix.

5. Add water and frozen mixed vegetables. Stir.

6. Set the pressure cooker to manual mode, high pressure, 0 minutes, natural
release, and start.

7. Remove the base of cilantro stems, and wash and roughly chop the leaves and
stems.

8. After the pressure cooker has reached pressure (about 10 minutes), wait about
30 minutes, release the remaining pressure, then open the lid.

9. Stir in the chopped cilantro.
