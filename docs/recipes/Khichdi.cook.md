## Steps
### Section 1
Khichdi is a classic Indian rice and lentil porridge. This recipe is a quick and
easy version that uses frozen vegetables and an electric pressure multi-cooker.

### Prep lentils and vegetables
1. Mix white rice, moong dal, and masoor dal in a large bowl and rinse them 3-4
times with tap water.

2. Add water, salt, and frozen mixed vegetables to the same bowl.

### Prep spices
1. Set aside the ground spices in a small bowl: ground turmeric root, ground
coriander, ground cayenne pepper, and hing.

2. Set aside cumin seeds in another small bowl.

### Cooking
1. Set pressure multi-cooker to saut√©, add cooking oil, and pre-heat on medium.

2. When the oil is hot, add cumin seeds.

3. When the cumin starts to sizzle, add the ground spices.

4. After simmering the spices for about 1 minute, add the lentils, vegetables,
and water.

5. Set the pressure cooker to manual mode, high pressure, 0 minutes, and natural
release.

6. After the pressure cooker has reached pressure (about 10 minutes), wait about
30 minutes, release the remaining pressure, then open the lid.
