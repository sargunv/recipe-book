## Steps
### Section 1
This gravy can be used for different veg and nonveg curries.

### Prepare spices
1. Set aside cumin seeds in a small bowl.

2. Set aside salt, ground cayenne pepper, garam masala, ground coriander, ground
turmeric root, black pepper, and hing in a small bowl.

### Puree
1. Roughly chop red onion and roma tomatoes, and add to a blender container.

2. Add garlic, ginger root, and avocado oil to the blender container.

3. Puree until smooth.

### Cook
1. Heat avocado oil in a pan over medium heat.

2. When the oil is hot, add cumin seeds.
